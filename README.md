#  Automated Rain Shed Project

This project is an **automated shading system** designed to protect public spaces and homes from **rain and intense sunlight**.  
Using a combination of **humidity sensors, light sensors, and servo motors**, the system automatically deploys or retracts a shed cover.  
It also includes a **manual control option** for flexibility.

##  Features
- **Automatic Rain Detection** – Deploys shed when rainfall is detected.  
- **Sunlight Intensity Detection** – Extends shade when sunlight is too strong.  
- **Manual Override** – Allows users to control the shed manually.  
- **Servo Motor Mechanism** – Smooth rotation and reliable deployment.  
- **Compact & Scalable Design** – Can be implemented in **public parks**, **bus stops**, or **homes**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Arduino (C++)** – Sensor readings & servo control  
- **Humidity Sensor** – Detects rainfall  
- **Light Sensor (LDR)** – Measures sunlight intensity  
- **Servo Motors** – Controls the opening and closing mechanism  
- **Onshape (CAD)** – Designed 3D model of the shed mechanism

## ⚙️ Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)  
- Humidity sensor (e.g., DHT11/DHT22 or rain sensor module)  
- Light sensor (LDR + resistor)  
- Servo motors (2x for rotation mechanism)  
- Frame & Shed (DIY or 3D printed parts)
